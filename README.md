# BionicFramework - Team 4909's Robot Framework

Going forward, our code will be designed slightly differently than the standard [WPILib](http://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/4485). We are in the process of writing our own framework to make it easier to reuse code from year-to-year. In the past, we've always started from scratch every year, and it makes it very difficult to get to the more advanced features such as vision. 

As part of our BionicFramework initiative, we have focused on a select few types of subsystems that are repeated throughout the years.
